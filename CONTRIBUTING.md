# Contribution Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing to DWN-Server. It's people like you that make DWN-Server such a great tool.
Given that we're still in early stages of development, this contribution guide will certainly change as we near a release. Until then, things will be a bit ragtag but there's still plenty of opportunities for contribution.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open-source community seriously. Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Issues

- Feel free to open issues for any reason as long as you make it clear what the issue pertains to.
- Before opening new issues, please search to check if there is an existing issue.
- Existing issues with labels `bug`, `documentation`, `good first issue`, `help wanted` are excellent candidates for contribution and we'd be thrilled to get all the help we can get. You can take a look at all of the Issues that match the these labels [here](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22%2C%22good+first+issue%22%2C%22documentation%22%2C%22bug%22+)

### Working on the issue

- Check to see if anyone is already working on the issue by looking to see if the issue has a `WIP` tag.
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch named the issue number you're taking on (usally branch from `main`)
- Push that branch and create a draft PR
- Paste a link to the draft PR in the issue you're tackling
- We'll add the `WIP` tag for you
- Work away. Feel free to ask any/all questions that crop up along the way

### Pull Requests

- When ready, switch the draft PR to "Ready for review".
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.

## Development

### Tests

- Running the `npm run test` command from the root of the project will run all tests.
  - This is run via CI whenever a pull request is opened, or a commit is pushed to a branch that has an open PR.
- Make sure to cover added code with tests, if it should be tested

### Code Style

- Our preferred code style has been codified into `eslint` and `prettier`.
  - Feel free to take a look onto [eslint config](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server/blob/main/.eslintrc.cjs) and [prettier config](https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server/blob/main/.prettierrc.json).
- Running `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run prettier:fix`will auto-format as much they can. Everything they weren't able to will be printed out as errors or warnings.
- We have a pre-commit hook which would run both commands with attempt to autofix problems
- Make sure that no errors/warnings are introduced in your PR

### Code Guidelines

1. A `TODO` in comment must always link to a GitHub issue.
