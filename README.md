## Running online environment

Interested in contributing instantly? You can make your updates directly without cloning in the running CodeSandbox environment.

[![Edit in CodeSandbox](https://assets.codesandbox.io/github/button-edit-lime.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/TBD54566975/dwn-server/main)

# Installation

```bash
npm install @web5/dwn-server
```

# Package usage

```typescript
import { DwnServer } from '@web5/dwn-server';

const server = new DwnServer();

server.start();
```

# Running the server

## Running via docker

`docker run -p 3000:3000 -v myvolume:/dwn-server/data ghcr.io/tbd54566975/dwn-server:main`

This can run on services like AWS, GCP, VPS, home server (with ngrok or cloudflare), fly.io, render.com etc.
Ideally the volume is persistent so that data is kept (or has to be synced back from another DWN instance).

## Running a specific version

Running the command above will run the latest version at the time the image is pulled. If you need to run a specific version (and in many cases this is recommended) you can see the list published images here: https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server/pkgs/container/dwn-server/versions

To run a specific image:
`docker pull ghcr.io/tbd54566975/dwn-server@sha256:870e0f0f12016e6607060a81ea31458443f7439522fab2688d7a6706ab366c58`

## Running Locally for Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server.git
cd dwn-server
npm install
npm run server
```

## Building a docker image locally

A docker image is continuously published from this repository, but if you want to build it locally run:
`docker build -t dwn-server .`

# JSON-RPC API

[JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is a lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses JSON as a data format for exchanging information between a client and a server over a network. JSON-RPC is language-independent and transport-agnostic which makes it usable in a variety of contexts (e.g. browser, server-side)

With JSON-RPC, a client sends a request message to a server over a network, and the server responds with a response message.

The request message consists of:

- a method name (`method`)
- a set of parameters (`params`)
- an identifier (`id`).

The response message contains:

- the same identifier that was sent with the request message (`id`)
- the result of the method invocation (`result`)
- an error message if the method invocation failed (`error`)

## Available Methods

### `dwn.processMessage`

Used to send DWeb Messages to the server.

#### Params

| Property      | Required (Y/N) | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target`      | Y              | The DID that the message is intended for                                  |
| `message`     | Y              | The DWeb Message                                                          |
| `encodedData` | N              | Data associated to the message (e.g. data associated to a `RecordsWrite`) |

    "code": -50400,
    "message": "Unexpected token ';', \";;;;@!#@!$$#!@%\" is not valid JSON"
  }
}
```

#### Transporting large amounts of data

`RecordsWrite` data can be of any size. If needed, large amounts of data can be streamed to the server over http by:

- including the JSON-RPC request message in a `dwn-request` request header
- setting the `content-type` request header to `application/octet-stream`
- sending binary data in the request body.

> üí° Examples can be found in the [`examples`](./examples) directory.

#### Receiving large amounts of data

`RecordsWrite` data can be of any size. `RecordsWrite` messages returned as the result of a `RecordsQuery` will include `encodedData` _if_ the `RecordsWrite` data is under `9.77KB`. Data larger than this will need to be fetched using `RecordsRead` which can be done over http. The response to a `RecordsRead` includes:

- The JSON-RPC response message in a `dwn-response` header
- The associated data as binary in the response body.

Examples can be found in the `examples` directory.

> üí° **TODO**: Add examples in `examples` directory

# Hosting your own DWN-server

By default when you call `web5.connect()` there will be some bootstrap DWN nodes included which allow people to reach you via your DID.

You may want to run a DWN server just for you, or as a public service for you and your friends and family.
DWNs can be as simple as a docker image or a node process running somewhere.

DWN-servers can run anywhere you can run node.js or docker. http and websocket need to be available to the DWN server.
See below for some suggestions.

## Running on render.com

You can run an instance on the render.com service:

- Create a render.com account
- Fork this repo
- Upgrade your render.com account to a paid account
- Create a new "Web service" type application
- Choose the forked repo to run (or you can point to to the main repo)
- Choose the "starter" size instance
- Create a 1GB (or larger) disk, and mount it on /dwn-server/data

## Running with ngrok

You can run a DWN-server on your local machine or home server and expose it to the internet using ngrok.

First, install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download

Then run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v myvolume:/dwn-server/data ghcr.io/tbd54566975/dwn-server:main

## in another terminal:
ngrok http 3000
```

Note the resulting publicly addressable https url for your DWN instance.

## Running with cloudflared

Cloudflare has a tunnel service that you can use to expose your DWN server to the internet, if you run it on a server at home.
With https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared installed, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/dwn-server.git
cd dwn-server
npm install
npm run server

## in another terminal:

cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

## Running on GCP

(enterprising people I am sure can work it out)
